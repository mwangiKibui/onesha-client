If you want to show your appreciation for someone else's work, you can scroll to the bottom of the project and click the "Like" button, you can leave them a positive comment, or you can promote their work via social sharing sites like Twitter, Facebook or Pinterest. But please don’t upload other people's work into your own portfolio. This creates confusion about who originally authored the work (and we are all about people getting credit for what they create.

                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Your message must be a work inquiry regarding a design job or project.</li>
                                    <li> Please personalize the messages you send — don’t send boilerplate messages. They tend to feel impersonal and lack the detail necessary to be appealing. This means you should use their name, provide a brief description of the work or job for which you’re hiring, and any details you find compelling about the designer’s work on Onesha. </li>
                                    <li> Please make sure the creative you’re contacting is a good fit for your job or project as indicated by the work, bio and skills on their profile. Many creatives also declare the type work in which they’re interested on their profile — so make sure your message conforms with their stated preferences.</li>
                                    <li> Have a specific job or project in mind when contacting a creative Don’t ask if someone is generally looking for new opportunities or if anyone they know is looking for new opportunities.</li>
