                            old, it is legal for you to use our Services, and you are legally capable of
                            entering into a binding contract. <br>

                            <b>International Users: </b> Pages describing the Services are accessible from
                            around the world but this does not mean all Services or service features are
                            available in your country, or that user-generated content available via the Services
                            is legal in your country. Onesha may block access to certain Services (or certain
                            service features or content) in certain countries. It is your responsibility to make
                            sure your use of the Services is legal in the country where you live. Services are
                            not available in all languages.
                            <br>
                            Certain Services and Onesha Materials may be available only if you have paid a fee
                            or have provided certain account information. As used in these Terms, “Onesha
                            Materials” means any materials or software provided by Onesha under these Terms,
                            which may include materials that you or other users share through the Services.
                            <br><br>
                            You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the

                            Unless otherwise stated in a separate agreement, we are not responsible for (a) the

                            content, or (c) the security, privacy, or communications related to your content.

                            We may create limits on the use of Services or Onesha Materials, including
                            limitation on file size and storage space. Onesha may require you to delete your
                            content until you are within certain storage space limits.
                            <br><br>
                            For use of the Job Listing Service, don’t post any listings that point to specific
                            work contests or other opportunities that solicit customized and unpaid creative
                            work from creative professionals. Any such postings may be removed without refund.
                            <br><br>
                            We offer a paid "Talent Search" feature to recruiters and companies looking to
                            discover and hire creative talents. By uploading a public profile or public project

                        <h5>5. VISUAL CV SECTION</h5>
                        <p>
                            <b>VISUAL CV </b>is an application that allows users to create and publish personal
                            portfolio sites, leveraging their portfolio of projects published on Onesha. The
                            VISUAL CV service works in tandem with Onesha and a series of other services to help
                            users create, publish, and host their personal portfolio sites on their own URL or
                            another URL provided by the VISUAL CV Service.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Cancellation.</b><br> You must cancel your membership before it renews in order
                            to avoid billing of the subscription fees for the next subscription period. Onesha
                            does not accept cancellation requests via phone, email, or any method other than
                            logging into your Onesha account to cancel your service. Upon cancellation, all of
                            your content will be deleted from the primary servers that provide the Service. Your
                            content cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled. <br><br>

                            For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card you provided will
                            automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your
                            Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or Account capacity. It is your
                            responsibility to make sure you preserve Content in your account before you
                            downgrade. <br><br>

                            If your bandwidth usage exceeds either 1 GB/month, or the average bandwidth usage
                            (as determined solely by Onesha), we reserve the right to immediately disable your
                            account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth
                            consumption. <br><br>

                            We may temporarily suspend or take down your VISUAL CV if we think that it has been
                            compromised or attacked.

                            <b>Subscription Fees.</b><br> Certain Services require you to purchase a
                            subscription or membership in order to access all or part of such Services.
                            Subscription terms are available at **
                            <br><br>
                            You are responsible for paying all taxes levied in connection with your use of the
                            Services. Your ability to access the Services may require payment of third-party
                            fees (such as telephone toll charges, mobile carrier fees, ISP, data plan, credit
                            card fees, foreign exchange fees, etc.) which are solely your responsibility.

                        <h5>6. TERMINATION</h5>
                        <p>
                            You can stop using our Services at any time.
                            <br><br>
                            We may add, modify, or remove features or functionalities, and we may suspend or
                            stop a Service. We may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new
                            limits to our Services at any time.
                            <br><br>
                            Any fees that you paid prior to termination are not refundable. Termination of your
                            account does not relieve you of any payment obligations.
                            <br><br>
                            If the Service is terminated or discontinued, then we will make reasonable effort to
                            notify you and provide an opportunity to retrieve your content. If your group
                            administrator terminates your access to a Service, then you may no longer be able to
                            access content that you or other members of the group have posted to a shared
                            workgroup or shared workspace. You may, however, still access your content stored on
                            your account.

                            please let us know by filling out the form that you will find here. If you would
                            prefer to submit a notice to our Copyright Agent (address below) in writing, it must
                            contain all of the following:
                            <br><br>
                            (a) A description of the copyrighted work(s) you believe are infringed; <br>
                            (b) The exact location (URL) where the infringing material resides on the Service;
                            <br>
                            (c) Contact information so that we can reach you, such as email address,your

                            (d) A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the
                            Material identified in your notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by
                            the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and <br>
                            (e) A statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under
                            penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the

                            (f) Your signature <br><br>

                            Before you file an infringement notice, please carefully consider whether or not the
                            use of copyrighted material at issue is protected by the “fair use” doctrine, as you
                            could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice
                            where there is no infringing use. <br> Please also check to make sure you haven’t
                            authorized the use at issue (for example, whether you have given a creative
                            professional who prepared materials for your company the right to use those
                            materials as examples of his or her past work). <br> If you are unsure whether a use
                            of your copyrighted material constitutes infringement, please contact an attorney.
                            You may also wish to consult publicly available reference materials such as those
                            found at the U.S. Copyright website (www.copyright.gov) or at the Chilling Effects

                            If you believe access to your content was disabled or removed by Onesha as a result
                            of an improper copyright infringement notice, please send our Copyright Agent
                            (contact information below) a written counter-notice that contains all of the

                            belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
                            misidentification; <br>
                            (d) A statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the Federal District court for
                            the district where you reside (or of Nairobi County, Kenya if you reside outside of

                            notification under DMCA subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person. <br><br>

                            Before you file a counter-notice, please carefully consider whether or not your use
                            of the copyrighted material at issue is infringing, as you could be liable for costs
                            and attorneys’ fees in the event that a court decides your counter-notice
                            misrepresented that the material was removed by mistake. <br> If you are unsure
                            whether use of the material at issue constitutes infringement, please contact an
